                    <h4 id="prolog">Prologue</h4>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Aufa. Currently, I have just completed my studies at Bina Sarana Informatika University, 
                        majoring in D3 Information Systems. Indeed, I entered the world of programming when I started this college major.
                         I've had many experiences, not all of them pleasant. There were times when I even hated the programming world and considered quitting college. 
                         I once thought I didn't want to work as a software developer/web developer. Yet, here I am, deepening my programming skills. Isn't it ironic?
                          What initially made me dislike programming has now led me to pursue a career as a web developer. Okay, let me share how I got to this point in my journey.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4 id="gettoknow">Getting to Know The Programming World</h4>
                    <p>I enrolled in the Information Systems department not by choice. I didn't even know about this major when applying for college. 
                        I was more interested in fine arts and wanted to study fine arts or visual communication design (DKV). However, due to financial constraints, 
                        I searched for scholarships and found one at UBSI, specifically for the Information Systems department. Since I had already taken a gap year of 2 years, 
                        and it was around September when college registrations were closing everywhere, I felt I had no time to look for another scholarship.
                         So, I decided to apply immediately rather than delay for another year. That's when I first encountered the world of programming. Initially, 
                         I struggled to understand the course materials and often cried due to the difficulty of assignments. That's why I hated the programming world. 
                         It was tough at the beginning, but on the positive side, I absorbed some basic knowledge that is proving useful now, as I have dived into the programming world.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4 id="lbd1">Learning by Doing Part 1</h4>
                    <p>As time passed, I found myself destined for the programming world. In my fifth semester, the university required students to undergo internships or participate in government programs.
                         I joined the MBKM Wirausaha Merdeka government program, thinking that since the theme was entrepreneurship, I wouldn't encounter coding or programming. 
                         However, my group chose to create a digital product, and being the only IT student, I ended up creating the program for the product. 
                         That's where I started learning programming through hands-on practice. I didn't have time to study programming theories, so I explored all the code I could find on Google, ChatGPT, and YouTube.
                          There were many errors, but solving them taught me a lot. The good thing is that when I did have time for courses or theoretical learning,
                           I understood better because I had encountered the actual code that I didn't even know the names of before.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Learning by Doing Part 2</h4>
                    <p>After completing the government program, I faced my Final Project for graduation. Boldly, I chose to outline a web development project, 
                        even though my knowledge of web development was still very basic at that time. Once again, I learned through hands-on practice. In the first part, I learned to develop the Front-End Web with ReactJS,
                         and in this part, while working on my Final Project, I learned to develop the Back-End Web with Laravel. Like in the first part, I encountered errors in this practical learning process as well.
                          From all my experiences, I gained the benefit that studying theory in-depth became easier because I had previously encountered the corresponding code.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h4 id="epilog">Epilogue</h4>
                    <p>Now, I am participating in the "Women in Innovation 2023" web development track bootcamp. The positive impact is that I already understand some basics, and I realize that I've grown because of my previous experiences. 
                        I also acknowledge that by daring to explore, I've learned a lot and haven't limited myself. You won't know something is difficult until you try it, and you won't grow if you always limit yourself. 
                        Okay, that's the end of my experience story. See you!</p>
